NodeJs - Javascript on the Server, a runtime javascript library uses v8 engine developed by google using c++ which compiles vanilla javascript into machine code. 
First app in node js

node file_name.js

second App in node js

Create a file with written content in it
const fs = require('fs);

Server - database, authentication, business logic, input validation
NodeJs  - creates server and listes to incomming requests, handles requests, input validation and connects to database, return responses json , html , css, html

How web works?

Client/browser->enters domain name or page address->domain lookup after adress resolution->sends request to the server hosts at an particular ip address -> server sends response with appropriate files like html css and js(server can also be used for connecting the database server, user validation.
