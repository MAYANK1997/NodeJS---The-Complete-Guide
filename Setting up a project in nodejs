Start a node project with // npm init
package.json file is the core configuration file
we can define our own scripts in scripts property of json file
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  
  npm start to run the server
  
  Now to continuosly run the server with changes pushed to it we have to install the external packages from the npm repository. 
  One of the package is nodemon
  three ways to install the package are:
  
  globally to the machine 
  npm install package_name --g
  
  into the project with only development phase
  npm install package_name --save-dev
  
  into the production server
   npm install package_name --save
